      "The first day of my travels. Bags have been packed, cats are with a friend, said my goodbyes -- I'm all set. A 7-hour redeye flight to Iceland followed by a 3-hour flight to Amsterdam. An easy pass through customs and I've officially arrived. Amsterdam. The first stop on what is supposed to be a year-long journey around the world. It's a bustling city renowned for its beautiful canals and lively atmosphere. It's a cultural hub where 90+% of the residents there speak English and you can go just about anywhere in the city using public transit or by bike. In other words, it's the perfect first stop for an inexperienced traveler like myself. My name's Rob. I am a 27-year-old American and I'm planning on traveling the world for a year.",
